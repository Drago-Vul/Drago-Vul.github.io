    <h1>Drago Vulic's Extravaganza!</h1>
    <p>Heyo! This is a showcase of Drago's first steps into game development! Underneath is a showcase of some of the systems I worked on for the game, Unquenchable!

    <p>This is one of the animation controllers that I did for the player. I also did the same for all the enemies in our game too! I know, pretty impressive, right?
        Don't ask me why "Player Airborne" is the only one with incorrect syntax though.
    </p>

    <p>This is the credits scene! It's all animated and stuff, but as you can see, this is just an image. Are you sweating from how awesome it is? Me too. </p>

    <img src="GreyBoxing.png" alt="Grey Boxing">
    <p>This is what I'm most proud of... I did greyboxing for the second level of Unquenchable! My ideas inspired many of all the greats, like Hideo Kojima and Miyazaki
        of FromSoftWare. Did any of it get used? Good question...
    </p>

    <p>But that's about all I'm willing to share! All of the rest is super secret... plus this is my first step into game development, so I had to start somewhere, as I know
        all of this isn't too impressive, but I'm proud of it.
    </p>

    <p>This is also my first experience with HTML, so please forgive me if it's not too fancy. Everybody has to start somewhere</p>
